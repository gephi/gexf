## 1.2draft - Gephi 0.8 compatible

### Graph structure

- The node "label" attribute is now optionnal
- `<meta>` should be placed before `<graph>`

### Dynamics

- Rename the "timetype" attribute to "timeformat". This attribute is set on <graph> to specify how time information is encoded, either like a date or like a double.
- The "timeformat" is currently either float or date and default value is date. The float type is replaced by double, and is now the default value.
- Added "timeformat" types: integer and xsd:dateTime. DateTime is equivalent to timestamps.
- Add open intervals (non-inclusive): "startopen" and "endopen" attributes.
- `<slices>` and "slice" are renamed `<spells>` and "spell" correspondingly because slices are a different concept as remarked.

### Viz

- Add viz attributes support for dynamics.
- Add the alpha channel to RGB. Colors are now encoded in RGBA. It is a float from 0.0 (invisible) to 1.0 (fully visible). If omitted, the default alpha-value is 1.0 (no transparency).

## 1.1draft - Gephi 0.7 compatible

-  Modules are stabilized and new ones appear: hierarchy and phylogeny.

## 1.0 - Gephi 0.6 compatible

- First specification. Basic topology, associated data and dynamics attempt constitute the core, plus a visualization extension.
